<p>Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.</p><p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.</p><p>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.</p><p>We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.</p><p>Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.</p><p>We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p><p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</p><p>The regret on our side is, they used to say years ago, we are reading about you in science class. Now they say, we are reading about you in history class.</p><p>Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.</p><p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p><p>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.</p><p>We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.</p><p>Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but it’s actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the survival of the human species.</p><p>When I orbited the Earth in a spaceship, I saw for the first time how beautiful our planet is. Mankind, let us preserve and increase this beauty, and not destroy it!</p><p>I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine</p><p>Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p><p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p><p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p><p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.</p><p>If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.</p><p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p><p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil.

And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain?</p><p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p><p>The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p><p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p><p>We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other</p><p>That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.</p><p>Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.</p><p>Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.</p><p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p><p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world.</p><p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil.
